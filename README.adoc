= Jenkins DSL

The repository contains job definitions using https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job Dsl plugin].

== How to build it

`./gradlew clean build`

WARNING: The ran test only checks if your scripts compile.

== How to use it in Jenkins?

Check out the https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-dsl-plugin/wiki/Tutorial---Using-the-Jenkins-Job-DSL[tutorial].
Provide the link to this repository in your Jenkins installation.

The seed job for Spring Cloud should scan the `jobs/springcloud/*.groovy` files.

Remember to add `src/main/groovy` and `src/main/resources` for processing

WARNING: Remember that views can be overridden that's why the suggestion is to contain in one script all the logic needed to build a view
 for a single project (check out that `spring_cloud_views.groovy` is building all the `spring-cloud` views).

== I want to add a new job

If your job is a standard Spring Cloud job that:

 - can be built via `./mvnw clean install` and deployed with `./mvnw clean deploy`
 - has docs under `docs` and those docs can be built via `./mvnw clean install -Pdocs`
 - is using `spring-cloud-build` thanks to which boot version is parametrized
 - the job resides under the `spring-cloud` organization

you can just go to `io.springframework.cloud.common.AllCloudJobs` and add the name
of the repo to `ALL_JOBS` list. That way the default CI jobs and views will be created for
the master branch.

If your job needs to be building other branches except for master just add your proper
entries to the `JOBS_WITH_BRANCHES` map in `io.springframework.cloud.common.AllCloudJobs`.

If you have some custom builds just add the entry to `ALL_JOBS` and `CUSTOM_BUILD_JOBS`.
 Next you should just create your own implementation (check `io.springframework.cloud.ci.ConsulSpringCloudDeployBuildMaker`
 for an example). Remember also to call it from the seed job (e.g. `springcloud/spring_cloud.groovy:29` for Consul).

The views are automatically generated for you. They base on the name convention so check out
`springcloud/spring_cloud_views.groovy` - it's pretty straightforward.

== I want to add a new compatibility job for a latest branch

There's nothing that you have to do. If you've added the newest branch under `JOBS_WITH_BRANCHES`
the project automatically takes the latest branch version and reuses it as point of entry for
`JOBS_WITH_BRANCHES_FOR_COMPATIBILITY_BUILD`.

= Running Jenkins

Just run 

[source]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

and your jenkins with plugins present in `plugins.txt` will be ready at port 8080. 

In order to download the latest plugins:

[source]
----
1) Open in your browser
http://$JENKINS_HOST/pluginManager/api/xml?depth=1&xpath=/*/*/shortName|/*/*/version&wrapper=plugins" 
2) Store the XML to a file
3) Pipe the contents of the file to this command:
perl -pe 's/.*?<shortName>([\w-]+).*?<version>([^<]+)()(<\/\w+>)+/\1 \2\n/g'|sed 's/ /:/'
4) Store it as plugins.txt
----

Wait patiently for Jenkins to start - the job will be added automatically for you.

IMPORTANT: We're using the JMH Jenkins plugin which is not available anywhere in the marketplace.
We're trying to automate its installation but if it fails you can download the HPI from
https://bintray.com/marcingrzejszczak/jenkins/download_file?file_path=jmh-jenkins%2F0.0.1%2Fjmhbenchmark.hpi[here]
and upload it yourself. The tag is in the forked repo over https://github.com/marcingrzejszczak/jmh-jenkins/releases/tag/0.0.1[here]


= Configuring Jenkins for Spring Cloud

You have to provide the following values/plugin configuration for your Jenkins to make everything work:

.Table Things to do
|===
|Property Name/Plugin name |Description

|CF_USERNAME
|The name of the Cloud Foundry user that access the Spring Cloud e2e space

|CF_PASSWORD
|The password for the Cloud Foundry user that access the Spring Cloud e2e space

|CF_SPACE
|The name of the space in Cloud Foundry that has e2e tests

|Git plugin
|You have to provide the username and email for the user that access artifactory

|Global Slack Notifier
|Provide team / integration token values to notify Slack

|Cloud plugin
|Provide values for Cloud so that jobs labeled for aws execution would work

|Cloud plugin
|The instances have to have proper values for JDK / JAVA_HOME

|Artifactory.DEFAULT_ARTIFACTORY_NAME
|The id of the Artifactory Repo is hardcoded in `io.springframework.common.job.Artifactory.DEFAULT_ARTIFACTORY_NAME`.
Most likely after a new installation it will change and the code will need to get updated.

|Maven Trait
|The trait io.springframework.common.job.Maven contains references to Maven installations. You have to have your
Jenkins Maven installations correspond to those entries.

|===

Also it's required to have Maven settings allowing you to push to artifactory.
